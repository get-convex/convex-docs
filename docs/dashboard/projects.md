A project corresponds to a codebase that uses Convex, which contains a
production deployment and one personal deployment for each team member.

Clicking on a project in the [landing page](https://dashboard.convex.dev) will
redirect you to project details.

## Creating a project

Projects can be created from the dashboard or from the
[CLI](/docs/cli.md#create-a-new-project). To create a project from the dashboard
click on the Create Project button.

## Project Settings

You can access project-level settings by clicking on the triple-dot `â‹®` button
on each Project card on the Projects page.

On the [Project Settings page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/project/settings),
you'll find:

- A form to update your project's name and slug.
- Instructions to regain access to your project, should you lose track of your
  `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` config.
- A button to permanently delete the project.
