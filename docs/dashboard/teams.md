In Convex, your projects are organized by team. Teams are used to share access
to your projects with other people. You may switch between teams or create a new
team by clicking on the team switcher located on the top of the Convex
dashboard.

The team switcher also allows you to search for projects within a specific team.

You may change the name of a team or invite new members to a team by clicking on
the "Team Settings" button located on the top of the project list page.
