  Convex Components package up code and data in a sandbox that allows you to
  confidently and quickly add new features to your backend.
</span>

Convex Components are like mini self-contained Convex backends, and installing
them is always safe. They can't read your app's tables or call your app's
functions unless you pass them in explicitly.

You can read about the full vision in
[Convex: The Software-Defined Database](https://stack.convex.dev/the-software-defined-database#introducing-convex-components)

The Convex team has built a few components that add new features to your
backend. You'll eventually be able to author your own components to use within
your project and to share with the community, but we haven't stabilized and
documented the authoring APIs yet.

We've listed components built by the Convex team below. Each component is
installed as its own independent library from NPM. Check out the component's
README for installation and usage instructions. You can see the full directory
on the [Convex website](https://convex.dev/components).
