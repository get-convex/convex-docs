  "Configure exception reporting integrations for your Convex deployment"

Configure exception reporting to gain visibility into errors from your Convex
function executions. Convex supports integration with
[Sentry](https://sentry.io/).

Currently, exception reporting is only available to Pro users.

## Configuring Sentry

To configure sentry, navigate to the
[Deployment Settings](/docs/dashboard/deployments/settings.md) in the Dashboard,
and the "Integrations" tab in the sidebar.

Click on the Sentry card and follow the setup directions. You will need your
[Sentry DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/concepts/dsn-explainer/).

## Sentry Notes

- If the function is [authenticated](/auth), then the
  [tokenIdentifier](/api/interfaces/server.UserIdentity#tokenidentifier) is used
  as the user id on Sentry. The `tokenIdentifier` is a stable and globally
  unique string representing the authenticated user.
- Sentry Exceptions may take a minute or two to propagate to Sentry.
- Convex's built-in sentry support does not yet support the advanced
  customization provided by the sentry SDK.
- Please reach out with any questions, comments, or suggestions
  [on Discord](https://convex.dev/community).
