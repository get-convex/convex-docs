[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React web development framework. When used
with Convex, Next.js provides:

- File-system based routing
- Fast refresh in development
- Font and image optimization

and more!

This pages covers the App Router variant of Next.js. Alternatively see the
[Pages Router](/docs/client/react/nextjs-pages-router/nextjs-pages-router.mdx)
version of this page.

## Getting started

Follow the [Next.js Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/nextjs.mdx) to add Convex to a
new or existing Next.js project.

## Adding authentication

### Client-side only

The simplest way to add user authentication to your Next.js app is to follow our
React-based authentication guides for [Clerk](/docs/auth/clerk.mdx) or
[Auth0](/docs/auth/auth0.mdx), inside your `app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx` file.
For example this is what the file would look like for Auth0:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx"
  sourceTS={Config}
  sourceJS={Config}
/>

Custom loading and logged out views can be built with the helper
`Authenticated`, `Unauthenticated` and `AuthLoading` components from
`convex/react`, see the
[Convex Next.js demo](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/nextjs-pages-router/pages/_app.jsx)
for an example.

If only some routes of your app require login, the same helpers can be used
directly in page components that do require login instead of being shared
between all pages from `app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx`. Share a single
[ConvexReactClient](/api/classes/react.ConvexReactClient) instance between pages
to avoid needing to reconnect to Convex on client-side page navigation.

### Server and client side

If you also want to access user information or load Convex data requiring
`ctx.auth` from Server Components, Server Actions or Route Handlers, you need to
use the Next.js specific SDKs provided by Clerk and Auth0.

Follow the respective quickstart:

- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/01-login)

Additional `.env.local` configuration is needed for these hybrid SDKs.

## Server rendering (SSR)

Next.js automatically renders both Client and Server Components on the server
during the initial page load.

To keep your UI
[automatically reactive](/docs/functions/query-functions.mdx#caching-reactivity)
to changes in your Convex database it needs to use Client Components. The
`ConvexReactClient` will maintain a connection to your deployment and will get
updates as data changes and that must happen on the client.

See the dedicated
[Server Rendering](/docs/client/react/nextjs/nextjs-server-rendering.mdx) page
for more details about preloading data for Client Components, fetching data and
authentication in Server Components, and implementing Route Handlers.
