The Convex database provides a relational data model, stores JSON-like
documents, and can be used with or without a schema. It "just works," giving you
predictable query performance in an easy-to-use interface.

Query and mutation [functions](/docs/functions.mdx) read and write data through
a lightweight JavaScript API. There is nothing to set up, and no need to write
any SQL. Just use JavaScript to express your app's needs.

Start by learning about the basics of
[Tables & Documents](/docs/database/document-storage.md),
[Reading Data](/docs/database/reading-data.mdx) and
[Writing Data](/docs/database/writing-data.mdx).

As your app grows more complex you'll need more from your database:

- Relational data modeling with [Document IDs](/docs/database/document-ids.mdx)
- Fast querying with [Indexes](/docs/database/indexes/indexes.md)
- Exposing large datasets with
  [Paginated Queries](/docs/database/pagination.mdx)
- Type safety by [Defining a Schema](/docs/database/schemas.mdx)
- Interoperability with data
  [Import & Export](docs/database/import-export/import-export.mdx)
