You can export your data from Convex using Snapshot export, which you can find
in the settings page of your project in the dashboard.

Alternatively, you can export the same data with the
[command line](/docs/cli.md#export-data-to-a-file):

```sh
npx convex export --path ~/Downloads
```

<BetaAdmonition feature="Snapshot export" verb="is" />

When you request an export, Convex will generate a ZIP file with all documents
in all Convex tables in your deployment. This may take a few seconds or a few
minutes, depending on how much data is in your deployment. You can download the
ZIP file by clicking on the link in the Latest Snapshot table.

Each export is a consistent snapshot of your data at the time of your request.
The ZIP file's name has the format `snapshot_{ts}.zip` where `ts` is a UNIX
timestamp of the snapshot in nanoseconds. The export ZIP file contains documents
for each table at `<table_name>/documents.jsonl`, with one document per line.

Exported ZIP files also optionally contain data from
[file storage](/file-storage) in a `_storage` folder, with metadata like IDs and
checksums in `_storage/documents.jsonl` and each file as `_storage/<id>`.

### Using the snapshot

Exported ZIP files can be imported into the same deployment or a different
deployment with the
[CLI](/docs/database/import-export/import.mdx#import-data-from-a-snapshot-zip-file).

```bash
npx convex import path/to/snapshot.zip
```

### What the snapshot doesn't contain

The snapshot ZIP file only contains the documents for your tables. In particular
it lacks:

1. Your deployment's code and configuration. Convex functions, crons.ts,
   auth.config.js, schema.ts, etc. are configured in your source code.
2. Pending scheduled functions. You can access pending scheduled functions in
   the [`_scheduled_functions`](/docs/database/advanced/system-tables.mdx)
   system table.
3. Environment variables. Environment variables can be copied from Settings in
   the Convex dashboard.

## FAQ

### Can I use snapshot export as an automated backup?

Right now, you can only access one export at a time, so this is not an automated
backup system. You are welcome to download your tables routinely, and feel free
to chime in [on Discord](https://convex.dev/community) if you would like to see
better support for backups.

### Are there any limitations?

Each export is accessible for up to 14 days (if no more exports are requested).
There is no limit to how many exports you can request.

Snapshot export uses database bandwidth to read all documents, and file
bandwidth if the export includes file storage. You can observe this bandwidth in
the [usage dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/team/settings/usage) as
function name `_cli/export`. Check the
[limits docs](/production/state/limits#database) for pricing details.
