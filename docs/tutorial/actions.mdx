# Convex Tutorial: Calling external services

In the [previous step](/docs/tutorial/index.mdx), you built a fully
self-contained chat app. Data in, data out.

Mutation functions in Convex are not allowed to make `fetch` calls to the
outside world since they are database transactions. Query functions are only
allowed to read from the database. The only way our app has talked the the open
web is through to our frontend app via the client library.

Real apps aren't this simple. They often need to talk to the rest of the
internet directly from the backend. Convex lets you do this too via **action**
functions.

Action functions let the sync engine access the external world by scheduling out
work that can then write data back via mutations.

Let's make our chat app a bit smarter by letting anyone in the chat get the
Wikipedia summary of a topic using the Wikipedia API.

## Your first `action`

**Add the following action to your `convex/chat.ts` file.**

```typescript
// highlight-next-line
// Update your server import like this:
// highlight-next-line
import { query, mutation, internalAction } from "./_generated/server";

//...

// highlight-next-line
// Add the following code to the file:
// highlight-next-line
function getSummaryFromJSON(data: any) {
  // highlight-next-line
  const firstPageId = Object.keys(data.query.pages)[0];
  // highlight-next-line
  return data.query.pages[firstPageId].extract;
  // highlight-next-line
}
// highlight-next-line

// highlight-next-line
export const getWikipediaSummary = internalAction({
  // highlight-next-line
  args: { topic: v.string() },
  // highlight-next-line
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // highlight-next-line
    const response = await fetch(
      // highlight-next-line
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&prop=extracts&exintro&explaintext&redirects=1&titles=" +
        // highlight-next-line
        args.topic,
      // highlight-next-line
    );
    // highlight-next-line

    // highlight-next-line
    return getSummaryFromJSON(await response.json());
    // highlight-next-line
  },
  // highlight-next-line
});
```

Let's walk through it:

1. First, we have a helper TypeScript function called `getSummaryFromJSON` to
   pull out the summary text from the JSON response.
1. Then, we created a new Convex action function called `getWikipediaSummary`.
   We used `internalAction` because we want this function to be private to the
   Convex backend and not exposed as a public API.
1. This function then does a simple fetch to the Wikipedia API with our topic.
   Then uses our helper function to extract the summary from the JSON response.

This is great and all, but how do I use it?

To quickly test this function in the Convex dashboard. Go to
https://dashboard.convex.dev and navigate to your project. Click on the
Functions in the left nav, and then click on the `getWikipediaSummary` function.
Click "Run Function".

The function runner UI will pop up. Try making a few searches.

## Hooking it up to your app

It's awesome that we can call Wikipedia, but we still need to show up in our
chat. So, let's hook it all up.

**Update your existing `sendMessage` mutation like this:**

```typescript
// highlight-next-line
// Import the api reference
// highlight-next-line
import { api, internal } from "./_generated/api";

//...

export const sendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    user: v.string(),
    body: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    console.log("This TypeScript function running on the server.");
    await ctx.db.insert("messages", {
      user: args.user,
      body: args.body,
    });

    // highlight-next-line
    // Add the following lines:
    // highlight-next-line
    if (args.body.startsWith("/wiki")) {
      // highlight-next-line
      // Get the string after the first space
      // highlight-next-line
      const topic = args.body.slice(args.body.indexOf(" ") + 1);
      // highlight-next-line
      await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.chat.getWikipediaSummary, {
        // highlight-next-line
        topic,
        // highlight-next-line
      });
      // highlight-next-line
    }
  },
});
```

Wait a second! What's with this `ctx.scheduler` stuff? Convex comes with a
powerful durable functions with the scheduler. It's a fundamental part of the
sync engine, and it's the way you coordinate multiple functions in Convex.

In the case of mutations, it's the only way to call an action to do a fetch to
the outside world. The really cool part is, if for some reason your mutation
fails, for example, if you throw an exception anywhere in the code, then nothing
is scheduled. This is because mutations are transactions, and scheduling is just
a write in the database to tell Convex to run this function at a future time.

Ok so, we can schedule our action, but we still need to write the summary back
to the chat.

**Let's go back and update our `getWikipediaSummary` action:**

```typescript
export const getWikipediaSummary = internalAction({
  args: { topic: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const response = await fetch(
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&prop=extracts&exintro&explaintext&redirects=1&titles=" +
        args.topic,
    );

    // highlight-next-line
    // Replace the `return ...` with the following.
    // highlight-next-line
    const summary = getSummaryFromJSON(await response.json());
    // highlight-next-line
    await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, api.chat.sendMessage, {
      // highlight-next-line
      user: "Wikipedia",
      // highlight-next-line
      body: summary,
      // highlight-next-line
    });
  },
});
```

Just like scheduling the action, we're now scheduling our `sendMessage` mutation
to send the result of our Wikipedia lookup to our chat.

Go ahead, now play with your app!

## The scheduler, actions, and the sync engine

</div>

Queries and mutations are the only ways to interact with the database and the
scheduler enables building sophisticated workflows with actions in between.

Actions are just an escape hatch. It's the reality of dealing with the messy
outside world with little to no guarantees.

Actions are not part of the sync engine. To talk to the database they have to
talk through query and mutation functions. This restriction lets Convex enforce
transactional guarantees in the database and keep the sync engine fast and
nimble.

The best way to structure your application for scale is to minimize the work
that happens in an action to only the part that needs the
[non-determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm), like
making the external `fetch` call. In an ideal scenario most actions are about as
simple as the action in this tutorial. This is the most scalable architecture in
Convex, enabling the highest throughput.

The scheduler allows your app to keep most of its important logic in queries and
mutations and structure your code as workflows in and out of actions.

## What you built

In this section of the tutorial, you built an action to talk to the outside
world and used the scheduler to trigger this work.

You learned that keeping our actions small and keeping most of our work in
queries and mutations are fundamental to building scalable Convex backends.

## Next up

You've now learned the most important concepts in Convex. As a full-featured
backend, Convex is capable of many things such as
[authentication](/docs/auth.mdx), [file storage](/docs/file-storage.mdx) and
[search](/docs/search.mdx). You can add those features as needed by following
the documentation.

We touched a little bit on setting your app up for success. As your application
scales, you will run into new challenges. Let's learn how to deal with some of
these challenges in the [next section â†’](/docs/tutorial/scale.mdx).
