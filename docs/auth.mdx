Authentication allows you to identify users and restrict what data they can see
and edit.

Your product will need a way for users to sign up, log in, log out and, if
passwords are used, a way to recover access after losing a password. This is a
complicated feature set to implement, especially given that any bugs impact
security.

You can implement all of this using Convex, but we currently recommend that you
instead leverage a Convex integration with an existing third-party auth
provider. This will be much less work and a more secure solution. Choose from
one of the following integrations, which both provide login via passwords,
social identity providers and one-time email or SMS access codes:

- [Clerk](/docs/auth/clerk.mdx) is newer and has better Next.js and React Native
  support
- [Auth0](/docs/auth/auth0.mdx) is more established with more bells and whistles

You could also leverage social identity providers directly, such as Google,
Facebook, Apple or GitHub. Each provider has a different way to integrate their
service though, and in general this is more complicated than using the
integrations above.

[Custom Auth Integration](/docs/auth/custom-auth.mdx) describes how you can
integrate an identity provider on your own.
