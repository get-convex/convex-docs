Authentication allows you to identify users and restrict what data they can see
and edit.

## Convex Auth

You can implement auth directly in Convex with the
[Convex Auth](/docs/auth/convex-auth.mdx) library. It's an easy way to get up
and running and build a custom sign-up/sign-in flow via social identity
providers, one-time email or SMS access codes, or via passwords.

## Third-party authentication platforms

Alternatively, you can leverage a Convex integration with an existing
third-party auth provider. Integrating another service is a bit more involved,
but these platforms provide a ton of functionality on top of the authentication
basics:

- [Clerk](/docs/auth/clerk.mdx) is newer and has better Next.js and React Native
  support
- [Auth0](/docs/auth/auth0.mdx) is more established with more bells and whistles

After you integrate one of these, learn more about accessing authentication
information in [Functions](/docs/auth/functions-auth.mdx) and storing user
information in the [Database](/docs/auth/database-auth.mdx).

## Debugging

If you run into issues consult the [Debugging](/docs/auth/debug.mdx) guide.
