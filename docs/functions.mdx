Functions run on the backend and are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript). They
are automatically available as APIs accessed through
[client libraries](/docs/client/react.mdx). Everything you do in the Convex
backend starts from functions.

There are three types of functions:

- [Queries](/docs/functions/query-functions.mdx) read data from your Convex
  database and are automatically cached and subscribable (realtime, reactive).
- [Mutations](/functions/mutation-functions.mdx) write data to the database and
  run as a transaction.
- [Actions](/functions/actions.mdx) can call Open AI, Stripe, Twilio, or any
  other service or API you need to make your app work.

You can also build [HTTP actions](/docs/functions/http-actions.mdx) when you
want to call your functions from a webhook or a custom client.
