The Convex backend, client libraries, and CLI are all open-source. You can
explore everything on the [Convex GitHub page](https://github.com/get-convex).

## Convex Backend

The [open-source Convex Backend](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend)
codebase consists of just over 200,000 lines of code, which comprise the core
backend implementation of Convex. The majority of the backend is written in
Rust, with a healthy dose of TypeScript supporting the server-side function
environment.

While this is a single-machine version of Convex, it contains exactly the same
fully up-to-date code used by the cloud service. All app APIs are supported, so
any project that runs in the cloud service can be run by the open-source
backend.

You are welcome to use this code to run your application, either for local
testing or in production, but you are on your own managing it and ensuring the
system is reliable and secure. It doesn't include the scale-out services,
replicated database backend, production dashboard, or operational tooling.

You can learn more about open-sourcing at Convex in our
[announcement](https://news.convex.dev/convex-goes-open-source/) and the
[software engineering daily podcast](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/03/20/going-open-source-at-convex-with-james-cowling/).
