Turns out Convex is automatically realtime! You donâ€™t have to do anything
special if you are already using [query functions](./functions/query-functions),
[database](./database), and [client libraries](./client/react/) in your app.
Convex tracks the dependencies to your query functions, including database
changes, and triggers the subscription in the client libraries.
