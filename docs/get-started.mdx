# A Tour of Convex

Convex is a novel, fun, and extremely productive way to make backends for your
full-stack apps using 100% TypeScript. So first, let's explore the dashboard!
Then, we'll get an example app up and running in a few minutes. We'll explore
how it works, improve it together, and along the way learn the fundamentals of
how to build your own projects in Convex.

## Explore the Convex dashboard

Before you get started we want to give you a quick tour of our dashboard. Click
on the button below to connect your Github and create a Convex account.

<CardLink
  className="convex-hero-card"
  item={{
    icon: <RocketIcon height={40} />,
    href: "https://dashboard.convex.dev",
    label: "Get started with an in-dashboard tutorial",
  }}
/>

In this tutorial you will learn about how to interact with data in the dashboard
and run functions. Once finished with the tutorial, you will be directed back
here to continue on with a new project.

## Start developing with Convex

<Details summary="Before you begin: You'll need Node.js 16+ and Git">

Ensure you have Node.js version 16 or greater installed on your computer. You
can check your version of Node.js by running `node --version` in your terminal.
If you don't have the appropriate version of Node.js installed,
[install it from the Node.js website.](https://nodejs.org/en)

In addition, this walkthrough requires Git. If you cannot run the `git` command
successfully in your terminal, head over to the
[Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for
instructions.

</Details>

First, clone the example project repo from GitHub:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/get-convex/convex-tour-chat.git
cd convex-tour-chat
```

In the project root directory, install `convex` and the other project
dependencies with `npm`:

```shell
npm install
```

Finally, this app's `dev` npm command sets up Convex and then runs the web app:

```shell
npm run dev
```

During setup, you'll see that Convex uses your GitHub account for
authentication. Sign into Convex with GitHub and then accept the default project
setup prompts.

**Make sure you keep this command (`npm run dev`) running in the background
throughout this tutorial.** It's running both the dev web server for the
frontend as well as the `convex` command in the background to keep your backend
in sync with your local codebase.

Once your app is up and running, open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
and check it out. You'll see a chat frontend running in Node.js on your
computer. This frontend connects to your new Convex backend hosted in the cloud,
which stores and retrieves the app's chat messages:

<div className="center-image" style={{ maxWidth: "700px" }}>
  ![Overview of Convex](/img/tutorial/TutorialFigure0.png)
</div>

<Admonition type="info">

Since we just checked this codebase out, you may wonder how it knows to connect
to _your specific_ Convex backend? Information about your project backend was
written to the `.env.local` file when we set up the project. When the app starts
up, the Convex client library uses an environment variable to connect to your
backend.

</Admonition>

For extra fun, pop up a couple of browser windows and watch Convex relay chat
messages between them:

<video autoPlay playsInline muted loop width="100%">
  <source src="/img/tutorial/who-chat.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <p>
    Screen recording of two different chat windows side-by-side with messages
    popping up instantly
  </p>
</video>

Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we're going to learn more about how this
app works and learn about how to build apps in general using Convex. We'll make
a few improvements to this app as we go, and finish by integrating some cool GPT
AI.

<Details summary="Dive into more projects first?">

If instead you want to see other example projects, head on over to our
[Template Gallery](https://convex.dev/templates), or see our
[Quickstarts](/quickstarts).

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      label: "Browse the Template Gallery",
      href: "https://www.convex.dev/templates",
    },
    {
      label: "Get up & running with Quickstarts",
      href: "/quickstarts",
    },
  ]}
/>

We still recommend you make your way back here eventually to learn the basics
about how Convex works and how to "think in Convex." Most developers find that
once they master the concepts in this tutorial, they're extremely comfortable
making new application architectures on the platform.

## Convex main ingredients

In the next three parts, we'll use this chat app to walk through the following
fundamental platform concepts:

1.  [**The Convex reactor**](/tutorial/reactor)<br /> First we'll explore the
    beating heart of Convex, a custom cloud-hosted reactive database called "the
    reactor." The reactor combines document-relational **tables** with
    deterministic TypeScript **query** and **mutation** functions.

2.  [**Convex and your app**](/tutorial/client)<br /> Next, we'll dive into the
    app's frontend code, and explore how to use Convex **client libraries** to
    seamlessly connect your hosted backend to your app.

3.  [**The broader platform and the outside world**](/tutorial/actions)<br />
    Finally, we'll touch on the broader backend features outside the reactor
    that work together to create a comprehensive backend platform. In
    particular, we'll go deep on **actions**, Convex's way to create powerful
    jobs that integrate your app with outside services like OpenAI.

Let's go!
