There are four reasons why your Convex
[queries](/docs/functions/query-functions.mdx) and
[mutations](/docs/functions/mutation-functions.mdx) may hit errors:

1. [Application Errors](#application-errors-expected-failures): The function
   code hits a logical condition that should stop further processing, and your
   code throws a `ConvexError`
1. Developer Errors: There is a bug in the function (like calling `db.get(null)`
   instead of `db.get(id)`).
1. [Read/Write Limit Errors](#readwrite-limit-errors): The function is
   retrieving or writing too much data.
1. Internal Convex Errors: There is a problem within Convex (like a network
   blip).

Convex will automatically handle internal Convex errors. If there are problems
on our end, we'll automatically retry your queries and mutations until the
problem is resolved and your queries and mutations succeed.

On the other hand, you must decide how to handle application, developer and
read/write limit errors. When one of these errors happens, the best practices
are to:

1. Show the user some appropriate UI.
2. Send the error to an exception reporting service using the
   [Exception Reporting Integration](/production/integrations/exception-reporting).

Additionally, you might also want to send client-side errors to a service like
[Sentry](https://sentry.io) to capture additional information for debugging and
observability.

## Errors in queries

If your query function hits an error, the error will be sent to the client and
thrown from your `useQuery` call site. **The best way to handle these errors is
with a React
[error boundary component](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html).**

Error boundaries allow you to catch errors thrown in their child component tree,
render fallback UI, and send information about the error to your exception
handling service. Adding error boundaries to your app is a great way to handle
errors in Convex query functions as well as other errors in your React
components. If you are using Sentry, you can use their
[`Sentry.ErrorBoundary`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/components/errorboundary/)
component.

With error boundaries, you can decide how granular you'd like your fallback UI
to be. One simple option is to wrap your entire application in a single error
boundary like:

```tsx
<StrictMode>
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <ConvexProvider client={convex}>
      <App />
    </ConvexProvider>
  </ErrorBoundary>
</StrictMode>,
```

Then any error in any of your components will be caught by the boundary and
render the same fallback UI.

On the other hand, if you'd like to enable some portions of your app to continue
functioning even if other parts hit errors, you can instead wrap different parts
of your app in separate error boundaries.

<Admonition type="note" title="Retrying">

Unlike other frameworks, there is no concept of "retrying" if your query
function hits an error. Because Convex functions are
[deterministic](/docs/functions/query-functions.mdx#caching-reactivity), if the
query function hits an error, retrying will always produce the same error. There
is no point in running the query function with the same arguments again.

## Errors in mutations

If a mutation hits an error, this will

1. Cause the promise returned from your mutation call to be rejected.
2. Cause your [optimistic update](/docs/client/react/optimistic-updates.mdx) to
   be rolled back.

If you have an exception service like [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) configured,
it should report "unhandled promise rejections" like this automatically. That
means that with no additional work your mutation errors should be reported.

Note that errors in mutations won't be caught by your error boundaries because
the error doesn't happen as part of rendering your components.

If you would like to render UI specifically in response to a mutation failure,
you can use `.catch` on your mutation call. For example:

```javascript
sendMessage(newMessageText).catch((error) => {
  // Do something with `error` here
});
```

If you're using an `async` handled function you can also use `try...catch`:

```javascript
try {
  await sendMessage(newMessageText);
} catch (error) {
  // Do something with `error` here
}
```

<Admonition type="caution" title="Reporting caught errors">

If you handle your mutation error, it will no longer become an unhandled promise
rejection. You may need to report this error to your exception handling service
manually.

</Admonition>

## Errors in action functions

Unlike queries and mutations, [actions](//docs/functions/actions.mdx) may have
side-effects and therefore can't be automatically retried by Convex when errors
occur. For example, say your action sends a email. If it fails part-way through,
Convex has no way of knowing if the email was already sent and can't safely
retry the action. It is responsibility of the caller to handle errors raised by
actions and retry if appropriate.

## Differences in error reporting between dev and prod

Using a dev deployment any server error thrown on the client will include the
original error message and a server-side stack trace to ease debugging.

Using a production deployment any server error will be redacted to only include
the name of the function and a generic `"Server Error"` message, with no stack
trace. Server
[application errors](/docs/functions/error-handling/application-errors.mdx) will
still include their custom `data`.

Both development and production deployments log full errors with stack traces
which can be found on the [Logs](/docs/dashboard/deployments/logs.md) page of a
given deployment.

## Application errors, expected failures

If you have expected ways your functions might fail, you can either return
different values or throw `ConvexError`s.

See [Application Errors](/docs/functions/error-handling/application-errors.mdx).

## Read/write limit errors

To ensure uptime and guarantee performance, Convex will catch queries and
mutations that try to read or write too much data. These limits are enforced at
the level of a single query or mutation function execution. The limits are:

Queries and mutations error out when:

- More than 16384 documents are scanned
- More than 8MiB worth of data is scanned
- More than 4096 queries calls to `db.get` or `db.query` are made
- The function spends more than 1 second executing Javascript

In addition, mutations error out when:

- More than 8192 documents are written
- More than 8MiB worth of data is written

Documents are "scanned" by the database to figure out which documents should be
returned from `db.query`. So for example `db.query("table").take(5).collect()`
will only need to scan 5 documents, but `db.query("table").filter(...).first()`
might scan up to as many documents as there are in `"table"`, to find the first
one that matches the given filter.

Number of calls to `db.get` and `db.query` has a limit to prevent a single query
from subscribing to too many index ranges.

In general, if you're running into these limits frequently, we recommend
[indexing your queries](/docs/database/indexes/indexes.md) to reduce the number
of documents scanned, allowing you to avoid unnecessary reads. Queries that scan
large swaths of your data may look innocent at first, but can easily blow up at
any production scale. If your functions are close to hitting these limits they
will log a warning.

For information on other limits, see [here](/docs/production/state/limits.mdx).

## Debugging Errors

You Convex dashboard or error reporting service will have the most useful
information about any error you or your users encounter. In development you can
also see stack traces directly in your browser console. In production though,
errors in the browser console are
[redacted](#differences-in-error-reporting-between-dev-and-prod).

To find the appropriate logs for an error you or your users experience, Convex
includes a Request ID in all exception messages in both dev and prod in this
format: `[Request ID: <request_id>]`. These messages can be found in exceptions
in your browser console, exception reporting service or
[log stream](/docs/production/integrations/log-streams.mdx).

You can copy and paste a Request ID into your Convex dashboard to view the logs
for functions started by that request. See the
[Dashboard logs page](/docs/dashboard/deployments/logs.md#filter-logs) for
details.
