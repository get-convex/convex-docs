From one off manual tests of your app, to unit testing, to end-to-end testing,
Convex supports a range of testing options.

## Testing your Convex functions

[Use the `convex-test` library](/testing/functions) with relevant mocks and
helpers to test your Convex functions. The library integrates with Vitest to
easily fit into your existing testing workflows.

## End-to-end testing

End-to-end testing is often used in integration test suites or CI runners. You
can use the Convex open source builds to run a full integration test suite.
[See the guide](https://stack.convex.dev/testing-with-local-oss-backend).

## Running a function in dev

Manually run a function in dev to quickly see if things are working:

- [Run functions from the command line](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-convex-functions)
- [Run functions from the dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard/deployments/functions#running-functions)

## Preview deployments

[Use preview deployments](/production/hosting/preview-deployments) to get early
feedback from your team for your in-progress features.
