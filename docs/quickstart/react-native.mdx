Learn how to query data from Convex in a React Native app.

<StepByStep>
  <Step title="Create a React Native app">
    Create a React Native app using the `npx create-expo-app` command.

    ```sh
    npx create-expo-app my-app
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Convex client and server library">
    To get started, install the `convex`
    package which provides a convenient interface for working
    with Convex from a React app.

    Navigate to your app and install `convex` and
    its peer dependencies.

    ```sh
    cd my-app && npm install convex react-dom react-native-get-random-values
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup a Convex dev deployment">
    Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
    will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
    create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.

    It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
    to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
    will then continue running to sync your functions
    with your dev deployment in the cloud.

    ```sh
    npx convex dev
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install .env helper tool">
    To configure your Convex deployment URL
    via `.env` files, in a new terminal window,
    install `react-native-dotenv`.

    ```
    npm install --dev react-native-dotenv
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Babel for .env files">
    To use the deployment URL directly from
    the `.env` files, configure babel.

    <Snippet
      source={babelConfig}
      title="babel.config.js"
      highlightPatterns={[ "react-native-dotenv" ]}
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create sample data for your database">
    Create a `sampleData.jsonl`
    file with some sample data.

    <Snippet
      source={sampleData}
      title="sampleData.jsonl"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the sample data to your database">
    Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table with the sample data into
    your Convex database with the `import` command.

    ```
    npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Expose a database query">
    Add a new file `tasks.js` in the `convex/` folder
    with a query function that loads the data.

    Exporting a query function from this file
    declares an API function named after the file
    and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.

    <Snippet
      source={tasks}
      title="convex/tasks.js"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the app to your backend">
    In `App.js`, create a `ConvexReactClient` and pass it to a `ConvexProvider`
    wrapping your component tree.

    Also import `'react-native-get-random-values'`.

    Finally include the `Tasks` component which we'll add in the next step.

    <Snippet
      source={App}
      title="App.js"
      highlightPatterns={[ "Convex", "get-random", "CONVEX", "unsaved", "}\\);", ]}
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Display the data in your app">
    Add a new file `Tasks.js` with a component using the `useQuery` hook to fetch
    from your `api.tasks.get` API.

    <Snippet
      source={Tasks}
      title="Tasks.js"
      highlightPatterns={[ "useQuery", "tasks", "text", "\\)\\)}" ]}
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the app">
    Start the app, scan the provided QR code with your phone,
    and see the serialized list of tasks in the center of the screen.

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

  </Step>

Are you trying to build a universal app targeting both browsers and mobile
devices? Use `npm create tamagui` and apply the steps above to the `apps/expo`
directory and the steps in the [Next.js Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/nextjs.mdx)
to the `apps/next` directory.
