Convex provides powerful search capabilities with both
[Full Text Search](search/text-search) and
[Vector Search](search/vector-search).

[Full Text Search](search/text-search) enables keyword and phrase search within
your documents. It supports both prefix and fuzzy matching. Convex full text
search is also reactive and always up to date like all Convex queries, making it
easy to build reliable quick search boxes.

[Vector Search](search/vector-search) enables searching for documents based on
their semantic meaning. It uses vector embeddings to calculate similarity and
retrieve documents that are similar to a given query. Vector search is a key
part of common AI techniques like RAG.
