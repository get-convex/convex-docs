Convex provides powerful search capabilities with both
[Full Text Search](/docs/search/search.mdx) and
[Vector Search](/docs/search/vector-search.mdx).

[Full Text Search](/docs/search/search.mdx) enables keyword and phrase search
within your documents. It supports both prefix and fuzzy matching. Convex full
text search is also reactive and always up to date like all Convex queries,
making it easy to build reliable quick search boxes.

[Vector Search](/docs/search/vector-search.mdx) enables searching for documents
based on their semantic meaning. It uses vector embeddings to calculate
similarity and retrieve documents that are similar to a given query. Vector
search is a key part of common AI techniques like RAG.
